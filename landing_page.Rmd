## Welcome {#welcome}
Welcome to the landing page for the London Enlightened Telegram community. Telegram is a chat app that many Enlightened agents around the world use to coordinate their activities, plan operations, meet for socials, and to swap cake recipes + cat memes.

We presume you are here because you might be interested in things like that.

## Getting set-up on Telegram {#telegramsetup}
What to do now?  Well first, make sure you have [Telegram installed](https://telegram.org/) on your phone or mobile device. Then [set your Telegram username](https://telegram.org/blog/usernames-and-secret-chats-v2) to be your agent name (or something similar if it's already taken e.g. 'DrManBun-Enl').

Optionally, if you have an android phone, you might consider replacing the Telegram app with [Plus Messenger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.plus). It still *is* Telegram, but with a nicer interface (in our opinion).

## For new players {#newplayers}
Have a look through the [new player chat rooms](#newplayerchatrooms) below, find your local region, and click on the link. This will add you to a chat room with a few local Enlightened agents who can talk you through any questions you have about the game, and in time give you permission to join the ['Verified'](#verifiedplayers) chat room for your area that area.

```{r include = F}
x    <- seq(as.Date(Sys.Date()), as.Date(Sys.Date()) %m+% months(1), by="1 day")
date <- x[wday(x,label = TRUE) == "Fri" & day(x) <= 7]
```

## Social events
Once a week we meet in a cafe or bar for an hour or two. Sometimes there are three of us, sometimes there are thirty. We focus mainly on having a chat and social, but we also normally build some high level portals so that we can hack high level weapons and resonators together. It's a nice opportunity to restock. Our next public event is on `r paste(day(date), months(date), year(date) )` at The Rocket near Euston if you fancy coming along. If you're worried about finding us, just look for a group of people with external battery packs connected to their phones! Failing that, ask in the [new player chats](#newplayerchatrooms) above.

## Useful bots and channels
There are a number of news channels and bots in Telegram that you might want to look at. Here's a few of our favourites.

* [IngressMosaikBot](https://telegram.me/IngressMosaikBot) - A bot that will show you banner missions near the location you send it
* [Enlightened Today](https://telegram.me/IEToday) - Enlightened news, facts and fun from around the world
* [V Bot](https://telegram.me/IEToday) - A bot for V related things
* [Rocks Bot](https://telegram.me/IEToday) - A bot for Rocks related things

## For verified players {#verifiedplayers}
The chat links shown in the 'Verified - local' and 'Verified - regional' rooms below are for Enlightened agents who are already active members of their local community and known to players of that area. To join those rooms you will need to be a member of the [Rocks community](https://enlightened.rocks/comm/) for that region. In addition, your Telegram name will need to be linked to a verified [Rocks](https://enlightened.rocks/me) *or* [v.enl.one](https://v.enl.one/profile/edit) profile.

If you aren't in the correct [Rocks community](https://enlightened.rocks/comm/), the link will not work for you. In addition, if your Telegram isn't linked to a [Rocks](https://enlightened.rocks/me) *or* [v.enl.one](https://v.enl.one/profile/edit) profile you will be immediately 'booted' from the chat room by a Telegram bot (sorry, we love you really).
